Q1.If a five-digit positive integer is entered through the keyboard, write a program to calculate the sum of its digits. Display an error message if the number entered is not a valid five digit number.

Q2.If a five-digit positive integer is entered through the keyboard, write a program to reverse the number. Display an error message if the number entered is not a valid five digit number.

Q3.If the lengths of three sides of a triangle are input through the keyboard, write a program to find the area of the triangle.

Q4.Consider a currency system in by which there are notes of seven denominations, namely Re 1., Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 50 and Rs. 100. If a sum of Rs. N is entered through the keyboard, write a program to compute the smallest number of notes that will combine to give Rs. N.

Q5.Write a program to accept two numbers and place them in two variables a and b. Interchange their values and display the result.

Q6.Write a program to receive values of latitude (L1,L2) and longitude(G1,G2) in degrees of two places on earth and output the distance (D) in nautical miles. The formula for the distance in nautical miles is D = 3963 cos-1(sin L1 sin L2 + cos L1 cos L2 * cos(G2-G1))

Q7.Wind chill factor (wcf) is the felt air temperature on exposed skin due to wind. The wind chill temperature is always lower than the air temperature and is calculated as follows wcf = 35.74 + 0.6215t + (0.4275t - 35.75) * v0.16 where v is wind velocity and t is the temperature. Write a program to receive the values of v and t and find the wind chill factor (wcf).

Q8.Write a program to find the cube root of an integer. If the input is not a perfect cube, display the number is not a perfect cube.
